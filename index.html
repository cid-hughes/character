"backstory":`  Orphaned at a young age and finding herself chafing under the stern but neglectful eyes of the orphanage Fiona escaped into the streets. There she honed her skill at pickpocketing in order to get by. The day to day was hard but livable but one day one of her marks noticed her and gave chase. She managed to blend into the crowd and escape but she heard him calling out that he would make her pay.
  It turned out that he was connected enough to make good on his threat. Though she was never caught her description was passed to all the city guards within the city forcing her to lay low. With her supplies running low she knew she had to leave the city but even the gate guards were looking for her. She needed a disguise.
  While running away from the gate guards she hid herself on a balcony where some clothing had been left out to dry. Among them were some child's clothes which she quickly put them on. It not only worked well enough to allow her to walk past the guards but a woman noticed her and after telling a story of being lost found herself in a home being fed and doted over.
  She did leave her city the next day but already the experience had given her ideas. She practiced her new role as she traveled and by the time she made it to the next city she was ready. She found someone to take her in quickly enough and even tell her their intent to adopt her! She stayed long enough to case the house and then one night slipped away with as much as she could carry.
  Its been years now and she has only gotten better. Currently she goes by the alias Anariele Lanoscient.`,

At first the chaos of magic and the distractions that it brought bothered Odran but over time and with much practice he found a way to merge it with his fighter training.

"backstory":`  Sarianna lived the typical life of a noblewoman until the day she received a summons from her sovereign. He had a situation that needed to be dealt with discretely. None of his people could do it as their involvement would be noticed. He needed Sarianna.
  As a noble she would be able to travel the country without suspicion and she was low enough in lineage that no would make note of her presence. He needed her to travel to another city. A noble who was selling information concerning troop movements would be there. Since he was noble it would be scandalous to arrest him so Sarianna's mission was to make him disappear.
  Traveling to the inn was easy as was meeting the man in the hall and convincing him to speak with her privately in his room. Even killing him was quick and as luck would have it his luggage was similar to hers so she stuffed him in one of his bags and moved it to her room. The next morning Sarianna, her luggage, and the bag containing the traitor were on the road heading back to her home.
  Since that day many other similar missions have come her way.  Although she has never gotten used to killing she cannot deny the thrill she gets from getting assignments, planning the missions, and manipulating people and events to allow her that time alone with her target. Sarianna would never admit this to anyone but she secretly looks forward to the next mission. Her only fear is that one day she will be caught in the act, mistaken for a common murderer, and bring shame to her family and sovereign.`,

"backstory":`  Zenna, born into a family of bards, has been surrounded by music her whole life. Even at an early age she yearned to follow her parents' footsteps. As soon as she could lift a lute she began playing. It soon became evident that she had real talent. Everything seemed to be falling into place for her to be the bard she dreamed of being until she tried singing.
  No matter how hard she tried she could not sing in tune. Her dreams seemed to vanish before her eyes. She felt lost, unsure of her future. She felt she had no choice but to leave her village, despite leaving being almost unheard of, to find her new path.
  She would travel town to town playing in inns to earn her keep. Eventually someone would request a sung balled. Embarrassed she would then move on to the next town. It was during one of her travels to a new town that she stumbled upon a caravan that had set up camp. She watched with rapt attention as one of the elders told ghost stories next to the campfire to the delight of the camp's children.
  At her next stop she tried her own hand at story telling. She knew many ballads from her family so she tried simply telling the tale as a poem instead of singing, playing her lute as background music and even using her illusion magic to show scenes to the audience. Despite her delivery feeling a bit clumsy it was a resounding success!
  Since then she has been refining her performance. She even mastered forming an ethereal magic hand to help, using it to play complicated pieces on her lute, to move things around the room, or even to startle an audience member. Her future seems to be coming back into focus. Now all she needs is to find new stories to tell!`,
